# Installation
This project is primarily designed as a standalone. It is likely to have conflicts with other plugins.

Only a server running linux can use this plugin, due to sigsegv mod dependency & lazyness.

## Compiling Dependencies

From there it should be as easy as just having those dependencies running and compiling the plugin!

Fair warning to hosters, this is buggy and very active in development.
