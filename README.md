# Incremental-Fortress
Sourcemod plugin which is a successor to Uber Upgrades.

# Features
Basically just a fully fledged out 1.0.0 for UU.

- Equal money distribution
- Revamped scaling
- (hopefully) balanced build choices
- Arcane System (which is meant to be a replacement for Ubertech)
- Powerups
- Weapon Modifiers instead of Special Tweaks
- MvM Wave Generator (currently not public as I'm rewriting it)
- Way too many additional attributes added
- Armor/defense system revamp
- Movement oriented combat (don't stand still)
- Actually fully working MvM support
- no windows support!

# Future
probably going to just leave it here to rot
